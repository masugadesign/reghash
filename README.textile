h1. RegHash

Help stop bot signups. Make member registration page use a 3rd-segment hash like:

http://site.com/members/register/349tgj459gh875gh

1) 3rd segment must be present
2) 3rd segment must match the current hash which changes (defaults to hour)

This should help stop bot signups, especially when coupled with a simple registration captcha.
